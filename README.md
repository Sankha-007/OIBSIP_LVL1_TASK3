# OIBSIP_LVL1_TASK3
This repository contains all the media files, .html files, .css files and .js files that I have used to build a functional TEMPERATURE CONVERTER using skills like HTML, CSS and JS. It has helped me to develop a strong foundational knowledge regarding all these skills.
This is my third and final task (LEVEL 1, TASK 3) as a part of my internship process with OASIS INFOBYTE.
User can use this site to convert temperature from one unit to another.
